```

## Data Exploration

*Initial data visualization*

First of all, it is important to visualize the main variable of interest. In this case, Mavoglurant is the main variable interest (variable response). Spaghetti plot is created to show the individual level of Mavoglurant over the time based on Dose (25, 37.5, and 50).

```{r}
# Spaghetti plot
spaghetti_pot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = TIME, y = DV, group = ID, color = as.factor(ID))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.6) +  # Adds individual lines with transparency
  facet_wrap(~DOSE)+ # to facet by dose
  theme_minimal() +  # Uses a clean theme
  labs(title = "Individual level of Mavoglurant over Time by Dose",
       x = "Time",
       y = "DV",
       color = "Subject ID") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # Hides legend if too many IDs
print(spaghetti_pot)

```

***Occasion Rate***

A bar chart for Occasion Rate (OCC) is created to look at the distribution of OCC. OCC is one of the interest in this exercise.

```{r}

plot_occ <- ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(OCC))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(OCC)), show.legend = FALSE, width = 0.7) +  # Color bars dynamically
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +  # Use a more vibrant color palette
  labs(title = "Distribution of Occasion Rate (OCC)",
       x = "Occasion Rate (OCC)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Increase text size for readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),  # Rotate X labels for clarity
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines for a cleaner look
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
print(plot_occ)

```

## Data Cleaning

First step in the data cleaning, we want to select only OCC= 1, and calculate summary of Mavoglurant

```{r}
#OCC =1 
data1 <- data %>%
  filter(OCC==1) #select rows with OCC=1 only 
```

```{r}
Summary_DV <- data1 %>%
  filter(TIME != 0) %>%  # Remove rows where TIME is 0
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarize(Y = sum(DV, na.rm = TRUE))  # Corrected sum function
print(Summary_DV)
```

Only including data with time= 0

```{r}
time_zero <- data1 %>%
  filter(TIME == 0)
print(time_zero)
```

Combine two data frames (Summary_DV and time_zero)

```{r}
data_combined <- left_join(time_zero, Summary_DV, by = join_by(ID))
print(data_combined)
```

```{r}
df <- data_combined %>%
  select(Y, DOSE, AGE, SEX, RACE, WT, HT) %>% #Selecting variables of Interest
  mutate(RACE = as_factor(RACE), SEX = as_factor(SEX)) #To convert race and sex to factor variables

str(df)# check the variable classes
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, the data is visualized using appropriate table, charts or graphics based on the data type. it is better to provide a big picture of the data by providing summary table (Characteristic Table). The table will help understand the data better.

*Create summary table*

```{r}

tbl_summary(df)


```

Based on the table above, 120 participants received a single 25 mg, 37.5 mg or 50 mg of MVG (49%, 10%, and 41% respectively). Most subjects were young (mean age of 33 years), race group one (62 %), male (87 %) with a mean BW of 83 kg and mean of HT of 1.76 m.

*Summary Table for all variables based on sex*

```{r}
# Summary table for all variables by SEX
df %>%
  tbl_summary(by=SEX, type=list(where(is.numeric) ~ "continuous"), # Specifies that all numeric variables should be treated as
              statistic=list(all_continuous() ~ "{median} ({p25}, {p75})"), #Numeric (continuous) variables will be summarized using the median and interquartile range (IQR: 25th and 75th percentiles).
              digits=list(all_continuous() ~ 0, HT ~ 2), # Specifies that all continuous variables should be rounded to 0 decimal places, except for HT (Height), which is rounded to 2 decimal places.

              label=list(Y ~ "Response",
                         DOSE ~ "Drug dose",
                         AGE ~ "Age",
                         RACE ~ "Race",
                         WT ~ "Weight",
                         HT ~ "Height")) %>%
  add_p(test=list(all_continuous() ~ "wilcox.test",
                  all_categorical() ~ "fisher.test"), # test differences between groups (SEX in this case).
        pvalue_fun=function(x) style_number(x, digits=3)) %>%
  modify_header(p.value="*p*-value") %>%
  modify_spanning_header(all_stat_cols() ~ "**Sex**") %>%
  as_gt()
```

For better understanding about the data, data are visualized in Histogram and Boxplot

*Histogram of Weight and height distribution*

```{r}

# Create a histogram for WT (Weight)
plot1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = WT)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#EEAEEE", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +  # Blue fill, black border, transparency
  labs(title = "Histogram of Weight (WT)",
       x = "Weight (kg)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Improves readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  geom_density(aes(y = ..count.. * 5), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1)  # Add smooth density curve


# Create a histogram for HT (Height)
plot2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = HT)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", fill = "#EEB4B4", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +  # Blue fill, black border, transparency
  labs(title = "Histogram of Height (HT)",
       x = "Height (cm)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
#Combine the histogram 
plot1 + plot2

```

Based on the Histogram of Weight, the weight is slighly skewed to the right. On the other hand, the height is skewed to the left. It is indicating that the data is not normally distributed both Weight and Heigth.

***Boxplot of Y variable based on Categorical Variables***

Boxplots were created to better visualization between response variable based on sex, race and dose.

```{r}

# Boxplot of Y by SEX
boxplot_sex <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(SEX), y = Y, fill = factor(SEX))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +  # Add transparency and black borders
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Y by SEX",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Y") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Improve readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "none",  # Remove legend since SEX is on x-axis
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")  # Use a nice color palette

# Boxplot of Y by DOSE
boxplot_dose <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(DOSE), y = Y, fill = factor(DOSE))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +  # Add transparency and black borders
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Y by DOSE",
       x = "Dose",
       y = "Y") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Improve readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "none",  # Remove legend since DOSE is on x-axis
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")  # Use a distinct color palette

# Boxplot of Y by RACE
boxplot_race <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(RACE), y = Y, fill = factor(RACE))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +  # Transparent boxes with black borders
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Y by RACE",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Y") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Improve readability
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "none",  # Remove legend since RACE is already labeled on x-axis
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")  # Apply a nice color palette

# Combine the boxplots
(boxplot_sex + boxplot_dose) / boxplot_race

```

Based on the boxplot above, the mean of response (y) is higher in sex1 compared to sex 2. In the dose category, it can be seen that the higher dose, the higher mean of response variable Y. Moreover, Race 1 and 2 have higher mean of Y compared two other races.

*scatter plot of y based on continouse variables*

Scatter plot is better way to show the relationship between continouse variable (both response and predictors). Loess method is used to draw the regression line to clearly look at nonlinear relationship between Y and predictors.

```{r}

# Scatterplot of Y by AGE
plot_age <- ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE, y = Y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, fill= "#EE00EE", color="#EE00EE", stroke=1, shape=18) +  # Transparent points for better visibility
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +  # Regression line
  labs(title = "Y vs Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Y") + 
 theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10, color="black", face="bold"),
        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color="black"),
        plot.title=element_text(size=12, color="black", face="bold", hjust= 0.5,))

# Scatterplot of Y by WT (Weight)
plot_wt <- ggplot(df, aes(x = WT, y = Y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, fill= "#9ACD32", color="#9ACD32", stroke=1, shape=18) +  # Transparent points for better visibility
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +  # Regression line
  labs(title = "Y vs WT",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Y") + 
 theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10, color="black", face="bold"),
        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color="black"),
        plot.title=element_text(size=12, color="black", face="bold", hjust= 0.5))

# Scatterplot of Y by HT (Height) with correct color scale
plot_ht<- ggplot(df, aes(x = HT, y = Y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, fill= "#EE4000", color="#EE4000", stroke=1, shape=18) +  # Transparent points for better visibility
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +  # Regression line
  labs(title = "Y vs HT",
       x = "Height",
       y = "Y") + 
 theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=10, color="black", face="bold"),
        axis.text=element_text(size=8, color="black"),
        plot.title=element_text(size=12, color="black", face="bold", hjust= 0.5))
 
# Combine and output the three scatterplots
ggarrange(plot_age, plot_wt, plot_ht, ncol=3, nrow=1, align="h", 
          heights=c(1, 1, 1))

```

Based on the scatter plots above, it can be seen that there is no linear relationship between Y and the predictors. - For Age, the trend appears somewhat flat with fluctuations, indicating weak or no strong association. The confidence interval (shaded area) is wide, especially at the edges, suggesting greater uncertainty in predictions at extreme ages. There is a large spread of data points, meaning variability in Y is high across different age.

-   For Weight, the confidence interval is relatively narrow in the middle but widens at lower and higher WT values, indicating more uncertainty at extreme weights. There is a cluster of data points around a moderate WT range, with more variability at lower and higher weights.

-   For height, the LOESS curve exhibits a U-shaped or fluctuating trend, suggesting a non-linear relationship between Height and Y. Initially, Y decreases with increasing Height, but at certain points, it fluctuates and slightly increases. The confidence interval is wider at extreme heights, suggesting greater uncertainty in predictions. The spread of data is relatively uniform, but there are some extreme Y values.

```{r}
# Scatterplot Y vs Race
plot_race <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(RACE), y = Y, color = factor(RACE))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, width = 0.2) +  # Jitter to avoid overlapping points
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.3) +  # Boxplot for distribution
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Y by Race",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Outcome Variable (Y)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame border
  )

# Scatterplot Y vs SEX
plot_sex <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(SEX), y = Y, color = factor(SEX))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, width = 0.2) +  # Jitter to separate overlapping points
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.3) +  # Boxplot for visualization
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Y by Sex",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Outcome Variable (Y)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +  # Different color scheme
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame border
  )

# Scatterplot Y vs Doses
plot_dose <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(DOSE), y = Y, color = factor(DOSE))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, width = 0.2) +  # Jitter for better visualization
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.3) +  # Boxplot for distribution
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Y by Dose",
       x = "Dose",
       y = "Outcome Variable (Y)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3") +  # Different color scheme
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)  # Add frame border
  )

# Combine and output the three scatterplots
ggarrange(
  ggarrange(plot_race, plot_sex, ncol = 2, nrow = 1),  # Row 1: Two plots side by side
  plot_dose,  # Row 2: Full-width plot
  ncol = 1, nrow = 2,  # 2 rows total
  heights = c(2, 2)  # Equal height for both rows
)

```

Based on the scatter plot above, race 1 has a wider spread of Y values with more extreme values (outliers). The spread of Y for Sex 1 is slightly larger than for Sex 2. Sex 2 appears to have slightly higher median Y values. The interquartile range (IQR) suggests that the distribution of Y values differs between sexes.The median Y value increases with increasing dose. The spread of Y also increases as the dose increases. The dose group 50 shows the widest variability, with more extreme values.

```{r}

# Select only continuous variables (excluding categorical variables like SEX, RACE, DOSE)
df_cont <- df %>% select(where(is.numeric))

# Compute correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(df_cont, use = "complete.obs")  # Use only complete cases

# Visualize correlation matrix with correlation values
corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = "color",  # Color-coded visualization
         type = "lower",  # Show only lower triangle to reduce redundancy
         tl.col = "black",  # Black text labels for variable names
         tl.srt = 45,  # Rotate labels for better readability
         addCoef.col = "black",  # Show correlation values in black
         number.cex = 0.8)  # Adjust text size for correlation numbers

```

Based on the correlation matrix, DOSE is the strongest predictor of Y, showing a positive correlation (0.72). AGE does not seem to have a meaningful relationship with any variable. Weight (WT) and Height (HT) are moderately correlated (0.60), which makes sense biologically. There are weak negative correlations of Y with WT and HT, but their impact is likely small.

## Model Fitting

*Model 1: Y \~ Dose* For model fitting, I will start with simple model (y\~ DOSE). Tidymodels is used in this modeling.

```{r}
df$DOSE <- as.factor(df$DOSE)

# Linear regression: Y ~ DOSE
m1 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Y ~ DOSE, df)

# Output the fitting result
tidy(m1)
```

Interpretation:

-   Intercept (Baseline: DOSE 25): the estimated mean Y when using DOSE 25 is 1782.67

-   DOSE 37.5 (681.24): increasing DOSE from 25 to 37.5 leads to an increase in Y by 681.24 on average with p-value = 0.0018 (\< 0.05) → This effect is statistically significant.

-   DOSE 50 (1456.20): increasing DOSE from 25 to 50 leads to an increase in Y by 1456.20 on average. p-value \< 0.0001 → Strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.

*Model2: Y \~ all predictors*

```{r}
m2 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Y ~ ., df)

# Output the fitting result
tidy(m2)
```

Interpretation: - The intercept (4890.92) represents the expected Y value when all predictors are zero. - Dose 37.5, Dose 50, and Weight are statistically significant with Y. Doses have positive relationship with Y, while Weight had significant effect on Y. Other predictors are not statistically correlated with Y.

*compute RMSE and R-squared*

```{r}
m1_RMSE_R2<- predict(m1, df) %>%
  bind_cols(df) %>%
  metrics(truth=Y, estimate=.pred) %>%
  print()

m2_RMSE_R2<- predict(m2, df) %>%
  bind_cols(df) %>%
  metrics(truth=Y, estimate=.pred) %>%
  print()

```

Based on the RMSE and R-Squared, model 2 (all predictors) performed better fit to the data compared to Model 1 (Dose Only) with RMSE and R-Squared (666.31 and 0.51 respectively for model 1, and 590.31 and 0.62 for model 2).

*Model 3: Logistic Regression (Sex \~ Dose)*

```{r}
#SEX ~ DOSE
m3 <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(SEX ~ DOSE, df)
tidy(m3)
```

Interpretation:

The Intercept is significant, meaning there is an underlying distribution of SEX probabilities. Neither DOSE37.5 nor DOSE50 significantly affect SEX because their p-values \> 0.05. This suggests that DOSE does not strongly predict SEX.

*Model 4: Logistic Regression (Sex \~ All Predictors)*

```{r}
#SEX ~ all predictors
m4 <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(SEX ~ DOSE + AGE + RACE + WT + HT, df)

# Output the fitting result
tidy(m4)
```

Based on the output, only Height is significantly correlated with Sex. Dose levels have a small, negative, but non-significant effect on Sex. Age, race and WT are not significant with Sex.

*Calculate RMSE and R-squared*

```{r}
m3_RMSE_R2 <- predict(m3, df, type="class") %>%
  bind_cols(predict(m3, df, type="prob")) %>%
  bind_cols(df) %>%
  metrics(truth=SEX, estimate=.pred_class, .pred_1) %>%
  print()
m4_RMSE_R2 <- predict(m4, df, type="class") %>%
  bind_cols(predict(m4, df, type="prob")) %>%
  bind_cols(df) %>%
  metrics(truth=SEX, estimate=.pred_class, .pred_1) %>%
  print()

```

```{r}

# Create a data frame for both models
metrics_df <- data.frame(
  metric = rep(c("accuracy", "kap", "mn_log_loss", "roc_auc"), 2),  # Repeating metrics
  estimate = c(0.8667, 0.0000, 0.3843, 0.5919,   # First model
               0.9500, 0.7716, 0.1334, 0.9784),  # Second model
  model = rep(c("Model 1", "Model 2"), each = 4)  # Model labels
)

# Create a grouped bar plot
ggplot(metrics_df, aes(x = metric, y = estimate, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +  # Grouped bars
  labs(title = "Comparison of Model Performance Metrics",
       x = "Metric",
       y = "Score",
       fill = "Model") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Clean theme
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Model 1" = "lightpink", "Model 2" = "lightblue")) +  # Custom colors
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )


```

Interpretation: - Model 2 (accuracy 0.95) is more accurate in making correct predictions than Model 1 (accuracy 0.87). - Kappa measures how well the model's predictions agree with the true labels, adjusting for chance. Model 2 shows a much stronger agreement with the actual data, while Model 1 shows almost no agreement beyond chance. - Lower log loss indicates better probabilistic predictions. Model 2 has a significantly lower log loss, meaning its probability estimates are more reliable. - A higher ROC AUC means the model is better at distinguishing between classes. Model 2 is much better than Model 1 at identifying positive vs. negative classes.

# Module 10 Part 1

In this exercise, we will use the data from previous part.

```{r}

m10_df <- df %>% 
  select(-RACE) %>%
  mutate(DOSE = as.factor(DOSE)) # convert DOSE into factor

colnames(m10_df)
summary(m10_df)


```

First, I am setting a seed rngseed using a 7%% for train set and a 25% for test set.

```{r}
# Set seed
rngseed <- 1234
set.seed(rngseed)

## Model Fitting

In this part, I will fit two models with y as an outcome. Model one has one predictor (dose), and another model include all predictors. Plus Null Model, which can be used to compare the RMSE.

*The First Model*

```{r}
#  Y ~ DOSE 
m1_10 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Y ~ DOSE, train_data)


#Output 
tidy(m1_10)
```

*The second model*

```{r}
#Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT

m2_10 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT , train_data)

# output 
tidy(m2_10)
```

```{r}
#  Null Model 
m3_10 <- null_model() %>%
  set_engine("parsnip") %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  fit(Y ~ ., train_data)


#Output 
tidy(m3_10)
```

## Model Performance Assessment 1
```{r}
#Compute prediction on train data
dose_preds_train <-  predict(m1_10, train_data) %>% bind_cols(train_data)
all_preds_train <-  predict(m2_10, train_data) %>% bind_cols(train_data)
null_preds_train <- predict(m3_10, train_data) %>% bind_cols(train_data)
```


```{r}
# Print RMSE for  Y~DOSE 
RMSE_train_DOSE <- rmse(dose_preds_train, truth = Y, estimate = .pred)

# Print RMSE for Y~ All Predictors 
RMSE_train_All <- rmse(all_preds_train, truth = Y, estimate = .pred)

# Print RMSE for the NUll model 
RMSE_train_Null <- rmse(null_preds_train, truth = Y, estimate = .pred)


```

Based on the output from three different models, RMSEs for model with DOSE only, all predictors, and null are 702.8, 627.3, 948.36 respectively. We can conclude that Regression model including all predictors is the best model for the dataset with the lowest RMSE.

## Model Performance Assessment 2

In this part, cross validation is performed by using a 10 fold cross-validation (CV) to examine the performance of the models.

```{r}
#set seed
set.seed(rngseed)

#Getting the CV folds established
folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 10)

```

Now I am going to fit the model with only DOSE as predictor to 9 of the splits for 10 times, and calculate the RMSE

```{r}

#Y~DOSE 
# Model setting
m1_10_spec <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

# Set the workflow: model 1
m1_10_cv <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(m1_10_spec) %>%
  add_formula(Y ~ DOSE)

# Set seed
set.seed(rngseed)

# Fit the data
m1_10_cv_fit <- m1_10_cv  %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds)

# Mean and SE of RMSE
collect_metrics(m1_10_cv_fit)

```

Fitting model with all predictors

```{r}

#Y~ All Predictors 
# Model setting
m2_10_spec <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

# Set the workflow: model 1
m2_10_cv <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(m1_10_spec) %>%
  add_formula(Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT )

# Set seed
set.seed(rngseed)

# Fit the data
m2_10_cv_fit <- m2_10_cv  %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds)

# Mean and SE of RMSE
collect_metrics(m2_10_cv_fit)


```

Based on the output, Model 2 has a lower RMSE (652.77 vs. 696.71), indicating that it predicts the response variable Y more accurately than Model 1. The standard error (std_err) is slightly lower in Model 2 (63.60 vs. 68.10), which suggests that Model 2 is more stable across different CV folds.For the R², Model 2 has a higher R² (0.5608 vs. 0.5000), meaning it explains 56.08% of the variance in Y, compared to Model 1, which explains only 50.00%. The standard error of R² is slightly higher in Model 2, meaning there is more variation in R² across folds, but the difference is minor.

*Validate using different set.deed*

```{r}
# New Set seed
set.seed(3456)

#10-fold sapling 
folds_new_cv <- vfold_cv(train_data, v=10)


#Y~DOSE 

set.seed(3456)
# Model setting
m1_10_spec <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")


# Set seed
set.seed(3456)

# Fit the data
m1_10_cv_fit_new <- m1_10_cv  %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds_new_cv )


# Mean and SE of RMSE
collect_metrics(m1_10_cv_fit_new)

```

```{r}

#Y~ All Predictors 
# Set seed


# Fit the data
m2_10_cv_fit_new <- m2_10_cv  %>% 
  fit_resamples(folds_new_cv)

# Mean and SE of RMSE
collect_metrics(m2_10_cv_fit_new)
```

Model 2 performs better than Model 1, as it has a lower RMSE (643.02 vs. 690.78). This suggests that Model 2 has improved predictive accuracy and makes smaller errors in predicting Y. fFr R², Model 2 has a higher R² (0.5876 vs. 0.5624), meaning it explains more variance in Y. A higher R² suggests Model 2 fits the data better than Model 1. The result is consistent with original model.

## Model predictions

```{r}

# Generate predictions and combine with observed values
predictions_dose <- predict(m1_10, train_data) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Y ~ DOSE") %>%
  bind_cols(train_data %>% select(Y))

predictions_all <- predict(m2_10, train_data) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Y ~ All Predictors") %>%
  bind_cols(train_data %>% select(Y))

predictions_null <- predict(m3_10, train_data) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Null Model") %>%
  bind_cols(train_data %>% select(Y))

# Combine all predictions into one dataframe
predictions_df <- bind_rows(predictions_dose, predictions_all, predictions_null) %>%
  rename(Observed = Y, Predicted = .pred)

# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(predictions_df, aes(x = Observed, y = Predicted, color = Model, shape = Model)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") + # 45-degree line
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +
  labs(title = "Observed vs Predicted Values",
       x = "Observed Values",
       y = "Predicted Values") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```

From the plot, we can see that the data from the null model are a straight horizontal line (red line) since we predict the same mean for each observation. For model 1, which only includes dose, the data falls along three horizontal lines (blue lines). This may be because the DOSE variable only takes three values (25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg). Thus, we only get three different predicted values for the outcome. The model 2 looks the best since the points fall along the 45 degree line. However, there seems to be some pattern to the scatter with model predictions lower than observed values for high values.

Now plot predicted versus residuals:

```{r}
# Compute residuals for Model 2
residuals_df <- predict(m2_10, train_data) %>%
  bind_cols(train_data %>% select(Y)) %>%
  mutate(Residuals = .pred - Y, Predicted = .pred)

# Find the max absolute residual for symmetric y-axis limits
residual_limit <- max(abs(residuals_df$Residuals))

# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create residuals plot
ggplot(residuals_df, aes(x = Predicted, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = "blue") +  # Scatter plot of residuals
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") + # Reference line at 0
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-residual_limit, residual_limit)) + # Symmetric y-axis
  labs(title = "Predicted vs Residuals (Model 2)",
       x = "Predicted Values",
       y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

```

There is a residual pattern that there are more and higher negative values than positive values.

## Model predictions and uncertainty

```{r}
#set seed
set.seed(rngseed)

# Create 100 bootstrap samples
dat_bs <- bootstraps(train_data, times = 100)

# Fit the model to each bootstrap sample and store predictions
pred_bs <- matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(train_data), ncol = 100)

for (i in 1:100) {
  # Extract bootstrap sample
  dat_sample <- analysis(dat_bs$splits[[i]])
  
  # Fit model to bootstrap sample
  m2_bs <- linear_reg() %>%
    set_engine("lm") %>%
    fit(Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT, data = dat_sample)
  
  # Make predictions for original training data
  pred_bs[, i] <- predict(m2_bs, train_data)$.pred
}

# Compute mean and confidence intervals for predictions
preds <- apply(pred_bs, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.055, 0.5, 0.945)) |> t()
colnames(preds) <- c("Lower", "Median", "Upper")

# Compute point estimate from the original model
point_estimate <- predict(m2_10, train_data)$.pred

# Create dataframe with observed values, point estimates, and bootstrap statistics
plot_data <- train_data %>%
  mutate(Point_Estimate = point_estimate,
         Median = preds[, "Median"],
         Lower = preds[, "Lower"],
         Upper = preds[, "Upper"])

# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Y)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Point_Estimate), color = "black", shape = 16, alpha = 0.7) + # Point estimates
  geom_point(aes(y = Median), color = "blue", shape = 16, alpha = 0.7) + # Bootstrap median
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), color = "red", width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) + # Confidence intervals
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") + # 45-degree line
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 6000)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 6000)) +
  labs(title = "Observed vs Bootstrap Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Observed Values",
       y = "Predicted Values") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```

From the figure, we can see that the bootstrap median values align closely with the point estimate, which suggests that the model is fairly stable across different resampled datasets. Besides, the error bars show that the confidence intervals are wider at some higher values, ndicate higher uncertainty in those predictions. Again, most points fall along the 45 degree line except some predictions lower than observed values at high value area.


# Module 10 Part 3 

```{r}

# Make predictions on test data

all_preds_test <-  predict(m2_10, test_data) %>% bind_cols(test_data)

#compute RMSE for test data '

all_rmse_test <- rmse(all_preds_test, truth = Y, estimate = .pred)

print(all_rmse_test)


```


```{r}

predictions_train  <- all_preds_train %>% mutate(Dataset = "Train")
predictions_test  <- all_preds_test  %>% mutate(Dataset = "Test")



#Combine train and test predictions
pred_combined <- bind_rows(predictions_train, predictions_test)
```


```{r}
ggplot(pred_combined , aes(x = Y, y = .pred, color = Dataset, shape = Dataset)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +  # Scatter points for observed vs predicted
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +  # Reference 45-degree line
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +  # Set x-axis range
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +  # Set y-axis range
  labs(title = "Observed vs Predicted Values (Train vs Test Data)",
       x = "Observed Y",
       y = "Predicted Y",
       color = "Dataset") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plots Observed vs. Predicted values for the training and test datasets. This scatterplot compares predicted values of the outcome variable 𝑌 from the fitted model against observed values, separately for training and test data. The dashed 45-degree reference line represents perfect prediction (i.e., predicted = observed). Points closer to this line indicate better predictive performance. Triangles (blue) represent the training set, and circles (pink) represent the test set. The distribution around the reference line suggests the model captures the general trend in both datasets, though some variability is observed, particularly at lower and higher ranges of 𝑌, with a slightly wider spread in the test set. Overall, this plot supports the finding of Model with all predictors included porfoms better accross different datasets. 


I want to print RMSE for all models including train and data test
```{r}
summary_MRSE <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Null Model", "Model 1 (DOSE only)", "Model 2 (All Predictors)", "Model 2 (Test Data)"),
  RMSE = c(RMSE_train_Null$.estimate, RMSE_train_DOSE$.estimate, RMSE_train_All$.estimate, all_rmse_test$.estimate)
)

print(summary_MRSE)
```



### Conclusion 
The predictive performance of the models was assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE). The null model, which includes no predictors, had the highest RMSE (948.35), indicating poor predictive accuracy. Model 1, which included only the DOSE variable, showed a substantial improvement with an RMSE of 702.79. Model 2, incorporating all available predictors, further reduced the RMSE to 627.27 on the training data, suggesting that additional variables contributed meaningful predictive value. Model 2 achieved its best performance on the test data, with an RMSE of 518.22, indicating good generalization to unseen data. These results highlight the importance of including multiple relevant predictors to enhance model accuracy and reliability
