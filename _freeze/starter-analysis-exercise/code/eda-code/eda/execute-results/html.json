Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\n\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files.\nAnd sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn't need a Quarto file.\n\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you'll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\n\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\n\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables. \n\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\n# Setup\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nhere() starts at C:/Users/mn27712/MADA_NEW/muhammadnasir-mada2025-portofolio\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible.\n\n\n",
